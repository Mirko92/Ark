# Question 1
In an OOP language of your choice please solve the following problem:
Three Chihuahuas and three cats are in the waiting rooms of a veterinary
surgery to get vaccinated. Only two animals can go into the surgery at the
same time.
The animals are nervous and want reassurance from a vaccinated animal that
all is ok, so each time a pair of animals are vaccinated one is returned to the
waiting room, while the other is placed in the recovery room.
All animals must be vaccinated before getting fed and let home to their
owners.
Chihuahuas are small, but if they ever outnumber the cats in either the waiting
room or recovery they will attack the cats.
Find a series of vaccinations that will get all the animals safely vaccinated and
allow them home.
